# TODO: 2.  [Note: same _TODO_ as its matching one in module m1.]
#  Students:
#  __
#  These problems have DIFFICULTY and TIME ratings:
#    DIFFICULTY rating:  1 to 10, where:
#       1 is very easy
#       3 is an "easy" Exam 3 question.
#       5 is a "typical" Exam 3 question.
#       7 is a "hard" Exam 3 question.
#      10 is an EXTREMELY hard problem (too hard for a Exam 3 question)
#  __
#    TIME ratings: A ROUGH estimate of the number of minutes that we
#       would expect a well-prepared student to take on the problem.
#  __
#    IMPORTANT: For ALL the problems in this module,
#      if you reach the time estimate and are NOT close to a solution,
#      STOP working on that problem and ASK YOUR INSTRUCTOR FOR HELP on it,
#      in class or via Piazza.
#  __
#  After you read (and understand) the above, change this _TODO_ to DONE.

    What comes in: Nothing.
    What goes out: Returns a string as described in Side effects (below).
    Side effects:
      Prompts the user for and inputs:
        -- A positive floating point number
        -- A positive integer
        -- A string
      in that order (via three separate INPUT statements).
      Then computes the sum of the integer and floating point number,
      converts that result to a string, and returns the string that is
      the INPUT string followed by the COMPUTED string.
      No input validation is required.

    Example:
    Here is a sample run, where the user input is to the right
    of the colons:
         Enter a positive floating point number: 1.44
         Enter a positive integer: 4
         Enter a string: Peace & Love.

         Returns Peace & Love5.44
