# TODO: 2.  [Note: same _TODO_ as its matching one in module m1.]
#  Students:
#  __
#  These problems have DIFFICULTY and TIME ratings:
#    DIFFICULTY rating:  1 to 10, where:
#       1 is very easy
#       3 is an "easy" Exam 3 question.
#       5 is a "typical" Exam 3 question.
#       7 is a "hard" Exam 3 question.
#      10 is an EXTREMELY hard problem (too hard for a Exam 3 question)
#  __
#    TIME ratings: A ROUGH estimate of the number of minutes that we
#       would expect a well-prepared student to take on the problem.
#  __
#    IMPORTANT: For ALL the problems in this module,
#      if you reach the time estimate and are NOT close to a solution,
#      STOP working on that problem and ASK YOUR INSTRUCTOR FOR HELP on it,
#      in class or via Piazza.
#  __
#  After you read (and understand) the above, change this _TODO_ to DONE.
